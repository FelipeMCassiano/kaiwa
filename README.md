   cd kaiwa
   ```
2. **Run the application**
   ```bash

   ```
### Client: Interacting with Kaiwa
Kaiwa is an API-based chat backend, so youâ€™ll need a client to interact with it. A simple .NET console client has been built to demonstrate its functionality.
1. **Clone the project repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FelipeMCassiano/client_for_kaiwa
   cd client_for_kaiwa
   ```
2. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   dotnet run 
   ```
#### Note: To enable chat functionality, you need at least two clients running simultaneously. Each client represents a user.
